\chapter{Conclusion And Future Works}\label{chap:conclu}






In this thesis, we have presented approaches to increase the performance of solving 
Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) in presence of symmetries. 
The presence of symmetry in a problem hinders the performance of the solver.
Some trivial question for an human, like Can 100 pigeons fit in 99 holes?,
becomes almost impossible for a solver. The solver will explore each pair of pigeon, hole and 
will face to a combinatorial explosion.To deal with symmetries, we study the symmetry detection 
and the symmetry exploitation.

In \Cref{chap:symmSAT}, we develop $\libdsb$ a library that perform dynamic symmetry breaking.

It can be integrated easily to any CDCL solvers. It uses the strength of static symmetry breaking 

Experimental results show that our work challenge current state of the art symmetry breaking techniques


Nowadays, SAT solvers can handled huge problems with thousands of variables and clauses. 
It is primary due to efficiently cut off search space.

studies of detection and exploitation of symmetry breaking techniques.
