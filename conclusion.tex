\chapter{Conclusion And Future Works}\label{chap:conclu}



In this thesis, we have presented a way to increase performance of solving Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT)
on presence of symmetries. 

Nowadays, SAT solvers can handled huge problems with thousands of variables and clauses. 
It is primary due to efficiently cut off search space.

studies of detection and exploitation of symmetry breaking techniques.

Symmetries are
