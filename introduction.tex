\chapter{Introduction}\label{chap:intro}


\st{Nowadays, computers are powerfull and used in many applications in different domains.
On of this domain is critical application, these applications are running in planes, cars
and some software must be secure. Proving the correctness of these software leads
to combinatorial explosion.
}

Over the years, computers scientist have developed many techniques to solve 
this kind of problems like \emph{constraint programming} (CP) \cite{rossi2006handbook},
\emph{Propositional Satisfiability} (SAT) \cite{biere2009handbook},
\emph{Solver Modulo Theory} (SMT) \cite{barrett2018satisfiability}.

In this thesis, we focus on \emph{propositional satisfiability} that is used in many
applications in different domains: \emph{formal methods}: hardware model checking,
software model checking, etc; \emph{artificial inteligence}: planning; \emph{games resolution}:
sudoku, n-queens, \emph{Bioinformatics} : Haplotype inference,
\emph{design automation} : equivalence checking
 



At its most basic, symmetry is some transformations of an object that leaves this 
object unchanged. In the case of satisfiability problems it maps a solution of a problem to another
solution of the problem.
