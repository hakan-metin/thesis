\chapter{The Boolean Satisfiability Problem}\label{chap:preliminaries}
\minitoc
In this thesis, our goal is to exploit the symmetrical properties of SAT problems.
Before, we get to the heart of the matter, we first introduce the Boolean satisfiability (SAT)  problem.
This problem is a propositional formula representing the constraints of a system.
A tool that aims to satisfy such formulas is called a SAT solver. It answers $\sat$ when all constraints
present in the formula can be satisfied and $\unsat$ otherwise.


\section{SAT basics}
The most basic block of satisfiability problem is the \emph{Boolean} or \emph{propositional variable}.
It has two possible values : true or false (noted respectively $\true$ or $\false$).
We denote \emph{literal} $l$, a propositional variable or its negation.
For a given variable $x$, the positive literal is represented by $x$ and the negative one by $\neg x$.
Given a formula $\varphi$, we denote $\Vars_\varphi$ ($\Lits_\varphi$) the set of variables (literals) used in the formula (the index in $\Vars_\varphi$ and $\Lits_\varphi$ is usually omitted when
clear from context).
To build more complex formula, it exists different operators, $\neg, \lor$ and $\land$ that are respectively negation, disjunction and conjunction. Others operators like $\Rightarrow, \Leftrightarrow$ and
$\oplus, \cdots$ respectively called implication, equivalence and exclusive disjunction (xor), $\cdots$ can be written with the basic one.
For example $a \Rightarrow b$ can be expressed as $ \neg a \lor b$.
These operators have a different priority and given in decreasing order:
negation ($\neg$), conjunction ($\land$), disjunction ($\lor$). To ensure
the priority, constraints can be set between parenthesis.

%The meaning of basic operators are given in the following truth table~\ref{tab:truthtable}:
\begin{table}[!htbp]
 \centering
 \begin{tabular}{cc|ccc}
  $x$ & $y$ & $\neg x$ & $x \lor y$ & $x \land y$ \\
  \toprule
  0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
  \midrule
  0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\
  \midrule
  1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
  \midrule
  1 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 1 \\
  \bottomrule
 \end{tabular}
 \caption{Truth table of basic operators}
 \label{tab:truthtable}
\end{table}
The value given to each variable of a formula is called an \emph{assignment} noted $\alpha$ and defined as follows:
 $$\alpha: \Vars \mapsto \{ \true, \false \}$$
 As usual $\alpha$ is said \emph{total}, or \emph{complete}, when all elements of $\Vars$ have an image by
$\alpha$, otherwise it is \emph{partial}. By abuse of notation, an assignment is
often represented by the set of its true literals.  The set of all (possibly
partial) assignments of $\Vars$ is noted $\Assignments(\Vars)$.
A \emph{truth table} gives an evaluation of all possible assignment for a given formula.
\Cref{tab:truthtable} shows the evaluation of negation, conjunction and disjunction operators.
For convenience, true value (\true) is also represented as $1$, a false value (\false) is represented as $0$.
When a formula is always true independently from the assignment, it is called a \emph{tautology} $x \lor \neg x$ is 
an example of tautologous formula.

\subsection{Normal forms}
In Boolean logic, it exists some structural properties, called \emph{normal form}.
To present them, we first need to introduce \emph{clause} and \emph{cube} concepts.
A \emph{clause} $\omega$ is a finite disjunction of literals represented by:
 $$\omega = \bigvee_{i=1}^k l_i$$
 
 
And a \emph{cube} $\gamma$ is a finite conjunction of literals represented by:
$$\gamma = \bigwedge_{i=1}^k l_i$$

% Or equivalently by the set of its literals:
%$$\omega = \{l_i\}_{i \in \llbracket 1,k \rrbracket}$$
On respect to its size, a clause is said \emph{unary, binary, ternary, $n$-ary} if it contains respectively one, two, three, or $n$ literals.

The clause form has a property called \emph{subsumption}. 
When a clause $\omega_1$ is a subset of another clause $\omega_2$ noted $\omega_1 \subset \omega_2$. And any 
assignment that satisfies $\omega_1$ also satisfies $\omega_2$, so $\omega_2$ is \emph{redundant} towards $\omega_1$ and so can be removed of the formula.

\emph{Conjunctive Normal Form} (CNF) of a formula is a finite conjunction of clauses
 A CNF can be either noted:
  $$\varphi = \bigwedge_{i=1}^k \omega_i$$
  
\emph{Disjunctive normal form} (DNF) of a formula is finite disjunction of cubes and noted:
  $$\varphi = \bigvee_{i=1}^k \gamma_i$$
The following table is a summary of laws about Boolean formulas that allow to transform any formula to
a normal form.
\begin{table}[!htbp]

    \emph{De Morgan 1} & $\neg x \lor \neg y \equiv \neg (x \land y)$\\
    \emph{De Morgan 2} & $\neg x \land \neg y \equiv \neg (x \lor y)$\\

Every formula can be transformed into a normal form with different complexity and the resulting formula is 
\emph{equivalent}.  
In other words, every assignment $\alpha$ that satisfies formula $\varphi$  also models the resulting formula $\psi$
and vice-versa, denoted as $\varphi \equiv \psi$.
 Also, we say a formula $\psi$ is \emph{logical consequence} of a formula $\varphi$ is every model of $\varphi$
 is also a model of $\psi$ and is denoted as $\varphi \models \psi$.

Conjunctive normal form is the input form of state-of-the-art solvers. Any propositional
formula can be transformed in CNF form with a polynomial complexity. Conversely, DNF form have
an exponential memory complexity during the transformation.
Note that each cube in the problem in DNF form is a solution in the equivalent CNF formulas.
\hakan{Sharp SAT = transform CNF to DNF}

%A formula is said to be \emph{satisfiable} (\sat) if there is at least one assignment that satisfies it;
%otherwise the formula is \emph{unsatisfiable} (\unsat).

%\subsection{Satisfiability problem}
%A \emph{Boolean variable}, or \emph{propositional variable}, is a variable that
%has two possible values : true or false (noted respectively $\true$ or $\false$).
%A \emph{literal} $l$ is a propositional variable or its
%negation. For a given variable $x$, the positive literal is represented by $x$
%and the negative one by $\neg x$.
%
%A \emph{clause} $\omega$ is a finite disjunction of literals represented
%equivalently by $\omega = \bigvee_{i=1}^k l_i$ or the set of its literals
%$\omega = \{l_i\}_{i \in \llbracket 1,k \rrbracket}$. A clause with a single
%literal is called \emph{unit clause}.
%A clause is a \emph{tautology} if it is always true, a clause that contains a positive 
%and negative value of a clause for example.
%A \emph{conjunctive normal form (CNF) formula} $\varphi$ is a finite
%conjunction of clauses.  A CNF can be either noted $\varphi = \bigwedge_{i=1}^k
%\omega_i$ or $\varphi = \{\omega_i\}_{i \in \llbracket 1,k \rrbracket}$. We
%denote $\Vars_\varphi$ ($\Lits_\varphi$) the set of variables (literals) used in
%$\varphi$ (the index in $\Vars_\varphi$ and $\Lits_\varphi$ is usually omitted when
%clear from context).
%For a given formula $\varphi$, an \emph{assignment} of the variables of
%$\varphi$ is a function $\alpha: \Vars \mapsto \{ \true, \false \}$.  As usual, $\alpha$ is
%\emph{total}, or \emph{complete}, when all elements of $\Vars$ have an image by
%$\alpha$, otherwise it is \emph{partial}. By abuse of notation, an assignment is
%often represented by the set of its true literals.  The set of all (possibly
%partial) assignments of $\Vars$ is noted $\Assignments(\Vars)$.
%The assignment $\alpha$ \emph{satisfies} the clause $\omega$, denoted $\alpha
%\models \omega$, if $\alpha \cap \omega \neq \emptyset$. Similarly, the assignment
%$\alpha$ satisfies the propositional formula $\varphi$, denoted $\alpha \models
%\varphi$, if $\alpha$ satisfies all the clauses of $\varphi$. Note that a
%formula may be satisfied by a partial assignment. In this case, unassigned variable is called
%\emph{don’t care}.
%A formula is said to be
%\emph{satisfiable} (\sat) if there is at least one assignment that satisfies it;
%otherwise the formula is \emph{unsatisfiable} (\unsat).

\subsection{An NP-complete problem}
The SAT problem is the first NP-complete algorithm proven by Stephen Cook in 1971~\cite{cook1971complexity}.
NP-completeness means that a SAT problem can be solved with a non-deterministic machine in polynomial time (NP) and is also NP-hard. A problem is said NP-hard if everything in NP can be transformed into it in polynomial time. 
One of the most important unsolved problems in theoretical computer science is the P versus NP problem.
This question is one of the seven millennium prize problems.


\subsection{Easy to solve particular forms}
Some particular form of the SAT problems can be computed in linear time for 2-SAT~\cite{aspvall1979linear}
where each clause is in binary form. In this case, it suffices to create a graph in which each clause is transformed into implication. For example, the clause $x \lor y$ will be transformed into $ \neg x \Rightarrow y,
\neg y \Rightarrow x$. After computing strong connected component on this graph, a 
search of the positive and negative literal in the same  strong connected component suffices 
to determine the satisfiability of the formula. If it is the case, the formula is \unsat. Otherwise 
a solution can be deduce and the problem is \sat.

Other particular form  can be solved in  polynomial time like Horn SAT~\cite{aspvall1979linear} in which it suffices to  apply \emph{unit propagation} explained thereafter in \cref{sec:dpll} until fix point. Simply it satisfies unit clause to satisfy them. To finish decision procedure, the formula must contains only Horn clauses. If the empty clause is reached, then the problem is
$\unsat$ and $\sat$ otherwise.

Xor-Satisfiability  is also a particular form where each clause encodes exclusive or (xor).
This problem can be seen as linear equations. Gaussian elimination allows to solve this kind of
problem is polynomial time.


\subsection{Related problems}

Different kind of problems related to SAT is presented is this section.
One of them is sharp-SAT (\#SAT), it purpose is to count the umber of solution in CNF.
Note that, in DNF form it is trivial, it is just the number of cube present in the formula.

Another related problem is maximum satisfiability problem (MAX-SAT). In this case the problem
is to find the maximum subset of clauses that can be satisfied for a formula. Different variant
of this problem exists. For example, some constraints must be satisfied (hard clauses) and MAX-SAT
is applied on remaining \emph{soft} clauses.

The last related problem is quantified Boolean formula (QBF) where the quantifiers $\exists$ and
$\forall$ are present in the formula.


\subsection{Solving a SAT problem}
Two kinds of algorithms exist to solve satisfiability problems.
First, the \emph{incomplete} algorithm which does not provide any guarantee that will eventually report either any satisfiable assignment or declare that formula is unsatisfiable. This kind of algorithm is out of scope of this thesis. 
Second, the \emph{complete} algorithm, which provides a guarantee that if an assignment exists
it will be reached or it will declare that formula is unsatisfiable.
This section describes different \emph{complete }algorithm to solve a propositional formula.

\subsubsection{A naive algorithm}
A naive approach to solve a SAT problem is to try all possible assignments.
For a propositional formula with $n$ variables, it leads to $2^n$ assignments in the worse case.  
\Cref{fig:naive_algo} illustrate the search tree for a given problem with six variables.
In this case $\alpha_{11}$ ($\neg x_1, \neg x_2, x_3, \neg x_4, x_5, \neg x_6 $) is found as a solution of the problem. In the general case,
this algorithm is  intractable on real problems even for a formula with few variables.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]

 \input{fig/naive_algorithm.tex}
 \caption{All possible assignments for a problem with 6 variables}
 \label{fig:naive_algo}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Davis Putnam Logemann Loveland (DPLL) algorithm}\label{sec:dpll}
One of the first non-memory-intensive algorithm to solve the SAT problems is 
the Davis Putnam Logemann Loveland (DPLL) algorithm~\cite{dpll_62}. 
It explores a binary tree using depth first search as given in \Cref{algo:dpll}.
The construction of the tree is related to a \emph{decision} literal (\cref{algo:dpll:decision}) then,
recursive call with each value are checked.
When a leaf report \unsat (\cref{algo:dpll:unsatbranch}), other branches are explored.
By recursive construction of the algorithm, when positive and negative value of a literal reach \unsat,
solver \emph{backtracks} at most one level, this fact is called \emph{chronological backtracking}.
If all leaves report $\unsat$  the formula $\varphi$ is unsatisfiable \cref{algo:dpll:unsat}.
Finally, if any branch found a solution  i.e. the problem is empty,
formula is satisfiable corresponding assignment is returned (\cref{algo:dpll:sat1,algo:dpll:sat2})
\input{algo/dpll}
An important function in the DPLL algorithm is \texttt{unitPropagation} \cref{algo:dpll:unit} and
it is detailed in \Cref{algo:unitdpll}. It searches all unit clauses, then, to ensure satisfiability these literals must be true
and added to the current assignment. Formula is then simplified as follows, clauses that contains this literal are already satisfied
and can be deleted; negative literals are removed from the clause that belongs to them.
This procedure ends when either no unit clause remains or an inconsistency was found (empty clause).

\input{algo/unitdpll}
When DPLL algorithm is executed on the formula in \Cref{fig:naive_algo}, after the decision of literal
$\neg x_1$ and $\neg x_2$ unit propagation detects that $x_3$ must be true. This propagation prevents to 
explore assignments from $\alpha_1 $ to $\alpha_{8}$. Moreover, application to unit propagation 
provokes more unit clauses and leads directly to a solution. 
An important part of efficiency of DPLL is due to choose the variable that divides the search tree made by
the procedure \texttt{assignDecisionLiteral} . The objective of this function 
is to find a literal that will generate a maximum of unit propagation. Intuitively, decision literals 
can be viewed as ‘guesses’ and propagated literals can be viewed as ‘deductions’. Finding a optimal variable
is NP-Hard. Different heuristics exists to choose the decision variable,
some of them will be presented in the section~\ref{sec:heuristics}.

%\input{algo/puredpll}
%Another idea introduced by DPLL was \emph{elimination of pure literals},
%a literal is said pure if it only appear on one sign (positive or negative) in the problem.
%These literals are set to true in the assignment.
%On consequence, all clauses that own these literals are satisfied and so can be removed.
%
\subsubsection{Conflict Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) algorithm}\label{sec:cdcl}
The principal weakness of DPLL algorithm is to make same inconsistencies several times
(principally due to chronological backtracking), incurring unnecessary CPU usage.\\
Conflict Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) \cref{algo:cdcl} is another sound and complete algorithm
to resolve a SAT problem and overcome principal weakness of DPLL.

\Cref{algo:cdcl} gives an overview of CDCL, Like DPLL,  it walks on a binary search tree.
Initially, the current assignment is empty and decision level that 
indicated the depth of the search tree noted as $dl$ is set to zero.
Algorithm first applies unit propagation to the formula $\varphi$ for the current assignment $\alpha$ (\cref{alg:cdcl:unit}).
Note that it is  the same procedure as the one used for DPLL.
An inconsistency or a \emph{conflict} at level zero indicates that the formula is unsatisfiable, and the algorithm
reports it (\cref{alg:cdcl:unsat_start,alg:cdcl:unsat_end}). When the conflict is occurring at a higher level, it
reason was analyzed and a clause called \emph{conflict clause} is deduced (\cref{alg:cdcl:analyze}).
Working of this procedure will be clearly explained thereafter.
This clause is \emph{learnt} (\cref{alg:cdcl:learn}) (added to the formula). This clause is redundant from the current
formula and so as it does not change the satisfiability of $\varphi$. It also avoids encountering a conflict with the same
causes in the future.
The analysis is completed by the computation of a \emph{backjump}, solver unassign responsible literals and decrease the decision level (\cref{alg:cdcl:backjump}). As the level can be much lower than the current assignment this is called \emph{non chronological backtracking}.
Finally, if no conflict appears, the algorithm chooses a new decision literal 
(\cref{alg:cdcl:pick_start,alg:cdcl:pick_end}).
The above steps are repeated until the satisfiability status of the
formula is determined.

\input{algo/cdcl}

\subsection{Conflict Analysis}
A conflict is an inconsistency discovered by the solver, a situation that requires for a variable to be set 
simultaneously to the \true and \false value. \Cref{fig:conflict} shows an assignments that leads to a conflict.
First the solver chose $\neg x_1$ as decision then $\neg x_6$ and then $\neg x_5$. This last one propagates $x_4$
which in turn propagates $x_2$ and $x_3$. On clause $\omega_1$, $x_3$ needs to be $\true$ and $\false$ in $\omega_5$ so
a conflict appears.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
 \centering
  \input{fig/conflict}
 \caption{Decisions/Propagations that leads to a  conflict}
 \label{fig:conflict}
\end{figure}
This series of decisions would provoke same propagation and leads to the same conflict. To avoid this
situation, the solver needs to analyze the reason of the conflict with so-called \emph{implication graph}.
Implication graph represents the current state of the solver proof system. It records every dependency
among variables and so it is updated either when a variable is assigned on decision/propagation or  when a variable
is unassigned. The implication graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in which a vertex represents an assigned variable labeled as $l@dl(l)$ where $l$ represents assigned literal and $dl(l)$ represents the decision level of the literal $l$.
Root vertexes , that have no incoming edges, are literals chosen by decision heuristics and others are 
propagated literals.
Incoming arcs labeled with a clause represent the \emph{reason} of this propagation.
This clause must be assertive i.e. all  literals are false except one that is not yet assigned.
\Cref{fig:implication-graph} shows implication graph of the previous example (\cref{fig:conflict}) until the conflict.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
 \centering
 \input{fig/implication_graph}
 \caption{Implication graph}
 \label{fig:implication-graph}
\end{figure}

\texttt{analyzeConflict} procedure analyzes this graph to find the reason of the conflict. To do that, a search of
\emph{unique implication point} (UIP) is performed. UIP of a decision level in the implication graph is a variable
which lies on every path from the decision to the conflict. Note that, there are many UIP for a given decision level.
In such case, UIPs are ordered according to the distance with the contradiction. The first UIP is the closest to
the conflict. It is well known that the first UIP provides the smallest set of assignment that is responsible for the
contradiction~\cite{zhang2001efficient}.
An UIP divides the implication in two sides with a \emph{cut}, the \emph{reason side} contains decision variables 
that is responsible for the contradiction and the \emph{conflict side} that contains the conflict. Note that, UIP is always is the 
reason side. \Cref{fig:implication-graph} depicts two cuts in the implication graph.
Once the reason side of a conflict is established, a conflict-driven clause or conflict clause is produced.
It purposes to avoid same contradiction. To build this clause, it suffices to negate 
literals that have an ongoing arc to the  cut that contains first UIP. In \cref{fig:implication-graph}, produced
clause will be $\omega_l = \{x_1, \neg x_4 \}$. Since the information of this clause is redundant regarding 
the original formula. It can be added without any satisfiability restrictions. The conflict clause can be simplified
using the implication graph~\cite{sorensson2009minimizing} to reduce its size by detecting
redundancy. All leaned clause are store in clause database that is simply a vector of clauses.
\texttt{backjumpAndRestartPolicies} procedure is executed after producing the conflict clause.
It will unassigned all decision until the first one that is responsible for the inconsistency. Adding the conflict clause prunes search space that contains no solution. This is the key point of the CDCL algorithm. In our example \Cref{fig:implication-graph}, the target decision level is 1.
After backtrack, the conflict clause is assertive, the first UIP is the only variable that 
have not a value and will be propagated in the next loop of the solving algorithm.
If a conflict implied only one level, the decision variable must be assigned 
to the opposite value at level 0. This means that to ensure satisfiability of the formula,
this literal must be true without any decision.
 
 
\subsection{Heuristics}\label{sec:heuristics}
This section gives an overview of different heuristics present in modern SAT solvers.

\textbf{Decision heuristics}. Variable used to divide problems have a huge impact on the 
overall solving time by the solver. Decision variable may impact the number of propagation and so 
the depth of the search tree.
Variable State Independent Decaying Sum (VSIDS)~\cite{moskewicz2001chaff} is one of the decisions heuristic and used
nowadays in almost all solvers. Each variable has an activity and was increased by a multiplicative factor 
when it participates to the resolution of the conflict.
A solver has thousands conflicts during the solving and so activity of variables are very volatile.
Decision heuristics choose unassigned variable with the highest activity.
The idea behind this heuristic is to solve ‘hard’ part of problem at the top of the search tree.
Hence, it is much more efficient when coupled with the restart heuristics. 
Learning rate based branching (LRB~\cite{liang2016learning}) is a latest decision heuristic. It is a
generalization of VSIDS and its goal is to optimize the \emph{learning rate} (LR), defined as the ability to generate
learned clauses. The LRB of a variable is the weighted average (computed with \emph{exponential recency
weighted average} (ERWA))  value taken by its LR over the time. Unassigned variable with a highest LRB are chose as decision. 
The idea behind this heuristics is to keep variables that used to generate learned clause in the search tree.

\textbf{Restarts.}
Another important heuristic is \emph{restart}. Basically, the solver abandons it current assignment and so 
start from the top of the tree, while maintaining other information notably learned clauses but also scores of variables in the decision heuristic. 
It prevents the solver to get stuck in ‘hard’ (heavy tailing~\cite{gomes1997heavy} part of the search space and cannot escape due 
to backjump few levels after conflict resolution. Restart is best effort heuristics, hoping that,
with more information, a better assignment was made. Hence, in practice, SAT solvers usually restart after a
certain number of conflict. Empirically a solver with restart has a better result~\cite{huang2007effect} and is today
used in almost all state-of-the-art solvers.


\textbf{Cleaning clause database.}
Adding constantly all learned clauses will saturate presents memory in the machine and the 
problem cannot be solved. When some conditions are satisfied, some learned clauses are
deleted from the clause chosen with different heuristic criteria. The size of the clause
is one of them and is very often used by solvers. Effectively a clause is really useful when 
it participates to unit propagation. The smaller the clause, the greater its chance.
\emph{clause activity} is another heuristic, when a clause participate to conflict analysis 
its score is increment and lower activity will be removed. The last often used criteria 
is base on Literal Block Distance (LBD). It is a measure that compute the \emph{quality} of a clause
it is based on the number decision level presents in the clause. Clauses with high value of LBD will 
deleted from the clause database.


\subsection{Preprocessing / Inprocessing}
In order to optimize resolution time by the solver, some transformation to simplify the original formula can be applied.
This is done by \emph{preprocessing} engine before the start of solving.
When it is used at some point during the solving, usually after a restart, it is called \emph{inprocessing}.
Simplification of the formula is made by removing clauses and/or variables.\\

\emph{Variable elimination} simplification is based on \emph{resolution inference rule}.
Suppose two clauses $\omega_1 = \{x_1, x_i, ..., x_j \}$ and $\omega_2 = \{\neg x_1, y_i, ..., y_j\}$.
The resolution inference rule allows to derive a clause $\omega_3 = \{x_i, ..., x_j, y_i, ..., y_j\}$ which is called
the \emph{resolvent} as it results from resolving two clauses on the literal $x_1$ and $\neg x_1$.
Moreover,  applying variable elimination until either an empty clause is derived (unsatisfiable formula) or 
no more application of the resolution are possible (satisfiable formula). This is a complete algorithm to solve a SAT problem.
Its major issue is to explicitly generate all resolvent and can be exponential in CNF size.
Hence, the memory of the computer will be limiting factor.

\emph{The subsumption} is a simple principle to remove clauses. Suppose two clauses $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ such that
$\omega_1 \subset  \omega_2$, then $\omega_2$ can be safely removed from the original formula.
\emph{Self subsuming resolution} is a principle that uses resolution rules and subsumption.
The resolvent clause subsumes the original one. Examples $\omega_1 = \{x_1, \neg x_2, x_3\}$ and $\omega_2 = \{x_1, \neg x_2, x_3, x_4\}$,
 then resolvent clause will be $\omega_3 = \{x_1, x_3\}$ which subsumes $\omega_2$. This principle
is present in \texttt{SatElite}~\cite{een2005effective} preprocessor engine and used in almost all modern SAT solvers.
Other simplification techniques exist such that \emph{Gaussian elimination} which detects sub formula in a XOR-SAT
form and solve it in a polynomial complexity. Moreover, this technique can also be used as inprocessing~\cite{soos2010enhanced}. 
Some techniques exploit the structure of the original formula and add relevant clauses to speed up the resolution
time of the SAT solver. One of them use community structure of the formula to find good clauses to add into.
A preprocessor engine doing that is  \texttt{modprep}~\cite{ansotegui2015using}.
Usage of symmetries also adds relevant clauses in the formula and will be detailed in the next chapter.

\subsection{Parallel SAT solving}
With the emergence of multi-core architectures and increasing power of computers, one way to optimize the solving
of a SAT problem is the exploitation of these cores. Effectively, SAT problems are a good candidate for parallelism.
\emph{Portfolio} is a technique that launches several SAT solvers in parallel with different heuristics (decisions, restarts, ...) that 
communicates or not between us. When one of them found a solution or found that none exists, the overall computation is finished.
Another technique to make parallel SAT solver exists and called \emph{divide and conquer} in which the search space was divided 
dynamically according to positive and negative value of the decision literal. Several solvers cooperate to find a solution, 
each of them is assigned to sub formula induced by the division. Some specific techniques like load balancing and work stealing 
is applied to avoid a solver to be idle.
A recent framework \emph{PaInleSS} (a Framework for Parallel SAT Solving) can be used to easily create a new parallel 
SAT solver with different heuristics~\cite{le2017painless}~\cite{le2019modular}. Authors of this framework win the parallel 
tracks of SAT competition \footnote{\url{http://www.satcompetition.org/}} in 2018.
